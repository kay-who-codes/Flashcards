  "notes": "Part of Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) theory developed in the 1970s by Bandler and Grinder. Scientific support is extremely limited with multiple studies failing to replicate claimed patterns. Individual variations are significant, and many people show opposite or inconsistent patterns. Cultural factors, handedness, and individual differences affect eye movements. While popular in some therapeutic and sales contexts, the reliability for determining thought processes or detecting deception is not scientifically validated. Modern neuroscience shows eye movements are influenced by many factors beyond cognitive processing type."
